# Peer-graded-Assignment-getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
This is a repository, that I (Nils Eicke) have created for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course project.

Firstly the script load the definition of activities and set the names of the vector.
Then the test and trainings data are loaded and the names of activityid and subjectid are set.
Test and train data are bind together.

fetures are loaded, mean and std columns are determined.

Then an activity column is added and the names of the mean and std columns are set.

Finally the average of each column is calculated per activity and subject and the result is written into a textfile.
